I have simulated the 2D using model in python using the metropolis algorithm.<br/>
In the animations, you can see that when the lattice is initially 50% negative and BJ=0.7 (relatively low temperature), magnetic domains are formed and the avaerge spin approaches 0.<br/>
When the lattice is initially 75% negative spin atoms and BJ = 0.7, the average spin approaches -1. This means that the spins are oriented in the same direction.<br/>
When the lattice is initially 75% negative spin atoms but BJ = 0.2 (high temperature), the atoms have enough energy from the heat bath and do not orientate themselves in one direction. Therefore the average spin approaches 0.<br/>
